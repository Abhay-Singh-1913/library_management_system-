# Library Management System using Java (Console Based)

## Introduction
This Library Management System efficiently maintains library records, reducing the time spent on administrative tasks. It empowers librarians to perform actions such as adding books, searching for books, removing books, updating book prices, and viewing all books.

## Features of Library Management System
1. **User-Friendly Interface:** The system provides a user-friendly interface for librarians to seamlessly add, remove, and view the status of books, ensuring efficient library management.
  
2. **Book Management:** Librarians can easily add new books, remove issued books, and display detailed book information using different classes.

## Why Create the Library Management System Project Using Java?
Java, being an object-oriented language with features like platform independence, makes it an ideal choice for software development. Some key features of Java that contribute to its suitability for this project are simplicity, security, and its object-oriented nature.

**Developer:**
Name: Amit Chaurasiya

## MVC Architecture for Library Management System
The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture is employed in this project to organize the code into three main components:

1. **Model:** Represents the application's data and business logic, responsible for data manipulation and storage.
   
2. **View:** Represents the user interface, displaying data to the user and sending user input to the controller.
   
3. **Controller:** Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It receives user input, processes it, interacts with the Model to update data, and then updates the View.

### Project Structure
The project is organized into three packages following the MVC architecture:
- **edu.qsp.lms.model**
- **edu.qsp.lms.view**
- **edu.qsp.lms.controller**

This structure enhances code modularity and maintainability.

## How to Run the Project
To run the Library Management System project:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile and run the Java files.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions.

Feel free to contribute and improve the system for better library management. Happy coding!
